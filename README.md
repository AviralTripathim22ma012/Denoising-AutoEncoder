# Denoising Autoencoders Project

## Welcome to the Denoising Autoencoders Project!

### Overview
This project focuses on implementing denoising autoencoders, a type of neural network used for removing noise from data. Denoising autoencoders learn to map noisy inputs to clean outputs by reconstructing input data from corrupted versions of themselves.

### Key Features
- Implementation of a basic denoising autoencoder architecture.
- Training the autoencoder on noisy data and evaluating its performance in denoising.
- Use of standard loss functions and optimization techniques for training.
- Visualization of input, noisy input, and reconstructed output for qualitative assessment.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the codebase to understand the implementation of denoising autoencoders.
4. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to train the autoencoder and denoise sample data.

### Usage
- Train the denoising autoencoder on your own noisy datasets.
- Visualize the performance of the trained model by comparing input, noisy input, and reconstructed output.
- Fine-tune the model architecture and hyperparameters to improve denoising performance.
